<!-- The quart document for this page is located in the website_quart_docs
     directory. The documents I'm trying to link are in the LESSONS directory.
     Unfortunately, quarto paths in a qmd file are always relative to the
     location of that qmd file. This is why I need to prefix "../" to the
     paths here. Otherwise, quarto will try to search for a LESSONS directory
     within the website_quart_docs directory. -->
